# etch_a_sketch

Page that has an "etch-a-sketch" on it where you can click and drag to draw. This is made using a combination of html, css, and javascript. What I learned while making this: 
1. disabling of standard features, specifically the drag operation, which was cause the mouse up event not to register
2. Centering a flexbox item when there are only two items in the container
3. More javascript functions and event listners to help run code on certain events
4. The range input and how to get values from this to update a variable
